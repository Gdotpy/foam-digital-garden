### Short Story

### Things I'm grateful for

### Things I accomplished today
I migrated my notes from the block of notes to foam. Now I'm feeling a sense of clarity and organization. I'm liking this tool a lot. I feel empowered. I also finished the book I've been reading for 2 months, the picture of Dorian Gray.
